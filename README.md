## Cloud-Native CI/CD Pipeline for NodeJS App with Jenkins, Kubernetes & AWSCloud-Native CI/CD Pipeline for NodeJS App with Jenkins, Kubernetes & AWS

This project sets up a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for a NodeJS application, automating tasks such as building, testing, and containerizing with Docker. It includes vulnerability scanning, pushing the image to a secure registry, and deploying the application on AWS EC2 for integration testing. Additionally, the pipeline integrates AWS Lambda for automated function deployments and uses ArgoCD for Kubernetes-based continuous deployment (https://github.com/Amirul1994/solar-system-gitops-argocd.git). The project also includes publishing reports to AWS S3.
